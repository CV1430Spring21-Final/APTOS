CNN model that detects Diabetic Retinopathy

### Problem Statement

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease that arises due to diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness around the world. It's a hard disease to catch early on, when it's most treatable, due to lack of significant symptoms. 

DR contributes to significant global burden to due to the widespread prevalence of diabetes - 422 million patients around the world. Out of these patients with diabetes, 146 million people have some form of DR.

This makes DR a major problem around the world that needs to be tackled soon. One of the ways to reduce blindness caused by DR is to catch the disease early and that can be done by leveraging technology at the right places in the healthcare system.

Here in this paper we aim to showcase a deep learning based solution to automatically detect presence of DR in the retina. We feel that a solution like this can be very beneficial to catching DR early on in places where the patients to ophthalmologists ratio is very low. 

Eventually, as rates of early diagnosis of DR go up so will the cases of blindness as early stage disease can be treated effectively.
